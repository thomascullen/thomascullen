summary: "Yet another markdown editor"
---

Nearly every document I write is written in markdown. I have always been a fan of markdown editors that update the styling
of the document as you write it. Neno was my first project built with
[electron](electron.atom.io). The main idea behind Neno was to create a markdown
editor that would allow the user to easily update the styling of the preview. As
simple as it is, it has been my goto markdown editor since creating it.

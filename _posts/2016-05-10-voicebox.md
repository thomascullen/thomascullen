I created Voicebox as a way to learn more about [electron](electron.atom.io).
The idea was to use the HTML5 speech input API and native text to speech APIs to
create a simple voice control app. I  wanted it to be easy to extend so that
others could write their own responses to various voice commands. This lead to me
developing the 'responders API' allowing users to install extra responses &
functionality using NPM packages.

summary: "Matching graudates with jobs in the tech sector"
---

In 2014 I co-founded Huma, a market place that matched students & graduates with
tech jobs. Huma aimed to change the way companies currently go about hiring gradutes,
moving the focus away from resumes and looking instead to work preferences &
portfolios. By looking at the various preferences of a graduate we were able to
make data driven matches to provide companies with high quality candidates.

The product went live in Dublin, Ireland in 2015 and unfortunatly closed in
2016. The details of why we decided to shut down can be read [here](https://medium.com/@kevinholler/huma-is-shutting-down-a732db5c3ff0) in our announcement.

summary: "A lightweight Sass framework that lets you keep control"
---

Sakura is a collection of Sass mixins, functions & placeholders for rapid CSS
development. Unlike most Sass frameworks, Sakura does not override any of the
styling in your application. All of the UI components are built as Sass
placeholders & mixins allowing the developer to easily customize and extend
their own UI & use their own class names.
